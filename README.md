# ShoppingApp

<h2> A Complete, Working, Simple E-Commerce WebApp </h2>
<p> I built the simplest possible E-Commerce WebApp. This Project has: User Authentication, Adding a Product (Can be done by anyone), Buying Products, Cart System. Only thing missing here is a Payment System.</p>

<h3> How to Run the Project </h3>
<p> I have a virtual environment of Python in this project but I'm not sure if it will work on anything except MacOS (The System I'm using). So, keep that in mind. </p>
<p> But, if you are in MacOS follow the given steps: </p>

<h3> MacOS </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Download/Clone the Repository and go to ShoppingApp Directory </li>
  <li> Open Terminal in the directory and type: source ./bin/activate </li>
  <li> Then, type: python manage.py runserver </li>
  <li> Now, the website should be up and running in localhost:8000 </li>
</ul>

<h3> Other Operating Systems </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Make sure you have Python installed in your system </li>
  <li> Download/Clone the Repository and go to ShoppingApp Directory </li>
  <li> Download these python dependencies: django pillow. This can be done through: </li>
  pip install django pillow
  <li> Then, type: python manage.py runserver </li>
  <li> Now, the website should be up and running in localhost:8000 </li>
</ul>
